# This is the user-modifiable configuration file. Unless you're unlucky and
# your C compiler isn't supported, this is all you need to touch in order to
# configure mushspace.
#
# See below for individual settings and what they do. This file is split into
# two sections: "build flavour" and "mushspace configuration". The former
# concerns things like compiler settings whereas the latter is about what
# functionality should be enabled in the mushspace.
#
# Any settings marked "Boolean" must be set precisely to "y" or "n".

######## BUILD FLAVOUR

# The kind of C compiler used. This determines only which file in the
# tup/compilers directory is used.
#
# For example, if you use GCC, this should be set to "gcc", thus causing the
# settings in tup/compilers/gcc.tup to be applied.
#
# To specify the compiler path and flags, modify the tup/compilers files or
# create a new one.
CONFIG_CC_FLAVOUR=gcc

# Boolean: whether the code should be optimized.
CONFIG_OPTIMIZE=n

# Boolean: whether debugging information should be generated.
CONFIG_DEBUG=y

# Boolean: whether a native build should be made. That is, optimizations used
# that only apply to this platform.
#
# This may cause the resulting binaries to not function on other systems.
CONFIG_NATIVE=y

######## MUSHSPACE CONFIGURATION

# Boolean: include extended support for infinite loop detection?
#
# Has some runtime cost.
CONFIG_INFINITE_LOOP_DETECTION=y

# Boolean: perform expensive debugging of mushcursor functionality?
#
# DO NOT ENABLE EXCEPT FOR TESTING PURPOSES. This has a /huge/ runtime cost,
# making mushcursor slower than using mushspace directly!
CONFIG_EXPENSIVE_CURSOR_DEBUGGING=y
